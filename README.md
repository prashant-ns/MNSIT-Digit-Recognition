Handwritten Digit Recognition using Keras library
What is Handwritten Digit Recognition, and how does it work? The capacity of computers to detect human handwritten digits is known as handwritten digit recognition. Because handwritten digits are not flawless and may be generated with a variety of tastes, it is a difficult assignment for the machine. The answer to this problem is handwritten digit recognition, which utilizes a picture of a digit to recognize the digit contained in the image.
MNIST is a dataset created by MNIST. Among machine learning and deep learning aficionados, this is undoubtedly one of the most popular datasets. The MNIST dataset includes 60,000 training photos of handwritten digits ranging from zero to nine, as well as 10,000 test images. As a result, the MNIST dataset comprises ten distinct classifications. The handwritten numbers are represented as a 2828 matrix with grayscale pixel values in each cell.
